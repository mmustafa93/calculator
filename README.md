Calculator Web App (https://mmustafa93.github.io/calculator/)

A fully functional and responsive calculator web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project began as part of The Odin Project, designed to reinforce fundamental concepts of JavaScript and DOM manipulation. To enhance functionality and styling, I incorporated additional features and technologies such as CSS Grid for layout management, even though it wasnâ€™t covered in the initial course material.

Project Improvements

While this project initially adhered strictly to The Odin Projectâ€™s guidelines, I enhanced its functionality and design using additional technologies and concepts not yet covered in the curriculum:
	â€¢	CSS Grid: Replaced flexbox with CSS Grid for the button layout, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable code.
	â€¢	Dark/Light Mode: Added a dynamic theme toggle button with animations using SVG and CSS transitions.
	â€¢	Responsive Design: Integrated advanced media queries to improve usability on different screen sizes.
	â€¢	Overflow Management: Incorporated text-overflow: ellipsis and white-space: nowrap for better handling of long expressions in the display.

Future Enhancements

	â€¢	Keyboard Support: Allow users to perform calculations using their keyboard.
	â€¢	Memory Functions: Add support for MC, MR, M+, and M- buttons.
	â€¢	History Panel: Display past calculations for reference.
	â€¢	Advanced Calculations: Include square root, exponentiation, and trigonometric functions.
